    "abstract": "Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies affecting women worldwide. BRCA1 mutations have been identified as significant risk factors for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome. This study analyzed 10,000 patients with BRCA1 mutations and found a 70% lifetime risk of breast cancer development. The research also identified novel therapeutic targets including PARP inhibitors and CDK4/6 inhibitors that show promising results in BRCA1-deficient tumors.",

This comprehensive review examines the molecular mechanisms underlying insulin resistance, including defects in insulin signaling pathways, mitochondrial dysfunction, and chronic inflammation. Recent advances in therapeutic approaches including GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, and metformin are discussed in detail.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. This study investigates the complex interactions between amyloid-beta and tau proteins, revealing how amyloid-beta oligomers trigger tau phosphorylation and neurotoxicity. Novel therapeutic strategies targeting both proteins are explored.",
